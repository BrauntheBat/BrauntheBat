<br>If I make a typo or use a wrong word, and then correct myself, do NOT "correct" me or laugh. Unless I think my own mistake is funny. I won't get on your case about your spelling mistakes or grammar, I'd like the same respect in turn. I may not respond if I don't know you and you come up to me and just say "hi", as that sort of thing makes me anxious. Also, as much as I enjoy hanging out with my friends, I may sometimes need some space or time to myself. I enjoy RPing, but please ask beforehand.

### Comfort Ship
Braun the Bat x Sonic the Hedgehog (Braunic)
- They're so silly and not particularly romantic! Just like me and my own boyfriend!
- They have a Neutral/Swim Chao named Booger.
- Their fan kids are not considered canon to my main AU, and exist within an AU of said AU.
- They call each other "Blue hair and pronouns" and "Fruit bat" respectively.
- They are non-binary (they/them) and cis male respectively. Both are aro/gay, and Sonic is a trans ally!

### About my Sonic AU
The timeline of the AU mirrors that of the real world, to where Sonic is as old as his franchise, and major characters and personal favorites from every facet of the franchise exist in one universe (excluding Ken Penders characters), with a few guest characters, and plenty of OCs and fan kids.
